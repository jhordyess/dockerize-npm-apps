# Dockerize npm apps

Scripts for dockerize npm apps with Nginx. Note that this is just an example, if you need for production, you must add security configurations.

Run the `docker.sh` file, it will create a new container image with a custom name (default: `crazy/container`) and run it; so you can visit [http://localhost](http://localhost).

```sh
bash docker.sh
```

Run for PowerShell `docker.ps1`.

```ps1
& docker.ps1
```
